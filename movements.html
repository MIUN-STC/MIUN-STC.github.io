		<h2>Project structure</h2>
		<h3>Camera computer</h3>
		Two camera is capturing frames at the same time from a trigger signal.
		The video frames goes to the computer to be proccessed.
		<h3>Video processing</h3>
		The program receives frame from left camera and a frame from right camera the same time.
		Background subtraction and blob detection is used to find moving objects from those frames.
		Moving objects can be noise or birds. Another program procedure will filter out the noise by 
		looking at the continuity of the moving objects.
		If an object is perstistant then it will be classifed as a interesting object.
		Another program procedure will cross match intersting objects from left frame and right frame.
		Antoher program procedure will undistort the xy coordinate from the interseting objects and then calculates the 
		disparity between left and right to calculate xyz relative to the cameras global position.
